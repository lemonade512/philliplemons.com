The `old` directory has my code and blog posts from before my refactor to Kotlin.

Most of the configuration files are taken from the Ktor example appengine repository:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kotlin-samples/tree/main/appengine/ktor

The following commands are useful:
- `./gradlew appengineRun`
- `./gradlew appengineDeploy`
