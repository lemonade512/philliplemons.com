The project created in the [Gradle](https://ktor.io/docs/gradle.html) tutorial.

The `old` directory has my code and blog posts from before my refactor to Kotlin.

You can run the app with `gradle run`

See [this tutorial](https://ktor.io/docs/google-app-engine.html#configure-app-engine-settings) for
more info on how the appengine configuration was setup

To deploy, run `gradle appengineDeploy`
