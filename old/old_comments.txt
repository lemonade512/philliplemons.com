Interesting solution.

You could resolve the tampering issue by using a rolling checksum (the checksum of this action depends on the actions before it) if I edit my history to remove the hint request then the checksum won’t be correct and you can tell I’ve tampered.

Of course if I can get the hint while I’m not connected to the internet then I imagine it’s trivial to write a javascript bookmarklet that retrieves the hint without playing nice with your localstorage queue.

There are definitely ways to still cheat but we decided there are always going to cheat. For most of our early math exercises it would be easy to write a bot that just fills in the answer for you and submits it without Khan Academy ever knowing about it.
\n
That being said, this particular solution was meant to target a specific group of cheaters who had been causing trouble for teachers who use Khan Academy as a teaching tool. These kids are young and most likely can’t make their own sophisticated cheating tools. Perhaps in the future we will move towards a more secure way of doing things but for now we have satisfied the teachers who were having this problem.
