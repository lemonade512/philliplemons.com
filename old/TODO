# This is a list of TODO items that I just need to write down before I forget:
#	* Go through old posts to update for code standards
#	* Decide if you want to change the look and feel of your posts
#		- One option would be chaning font
#		- Another option would be to change the headings
#	* Make sure to update the README with full installation process
#		- Use a VM somewhere to test the full installation process
