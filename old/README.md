Introduction
------------

This is the code used to run my personal blog. I am using the
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) theme
[Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) created
by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Running Dev Server
------------------

First, you must have the latest Google Cloud SDK installed and initialized in
order to run the dev server.

Next, run the following command:
```bash
$ dev_appserver.py app.yml
```
